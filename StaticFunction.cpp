/*Static member functions are required when you need to:
Operate on static data members.
Call a function without needing an instance of the class.
Implement shared or class-level logic that is not tied to individual objects.
Implement utility, helper, or factory functions.
Improve efficiency by avoiding object creation when not needed.*/
